move with WASD and mouse

The charecter will begin to fall over when you run into walls, this is do to the object being a caplse under the efects of gravity
and the fact that unity's rigid body physics offten doesnt work as avertised for whatever reason (its bad). 
I could fix this by changing the player hitbox to a rectange or by manualy fixing the roation any time the player moves.
For now this a "feature" where the charecter gets "dizzy" ;)

press spacebar for to see the secret 4 walls to meet the 8 wall requirment

In an effort to quickly make the environmaet more interesting I added two free assets from the unity store
these are some railing assets and a space skybox texrture
